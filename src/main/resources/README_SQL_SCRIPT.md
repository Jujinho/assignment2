# SQL Script for Predefined Users

## Overview
The `predefined_users.sql` script creates sample data for the University Equipment Lending System. Since the system does not allow registration, this script predefines all necessary users and related data.

## What the Script Does

1. **Cleans Existing Data** (optional)
   - Removes any existing records from related tables
   - Resets ID sequences

2. **Creates User Accounts**
   - 1 Administrator
   - 2 Academic Staff members
   - 2 Professional Staff members
   - 3 Students

3. **Creates Sample Data**
   - 2 Courses
   - Student course enrollments
   - 3 Equipment items
   - 3 Lending records (2 returned, 1 borrowed)

## How to Use

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a client like pgAdmin or the command line.
2. Execute the script:
   ```
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f predefined_users.sql
   ```
   
   Or in SQL Server Management Studio:
   - Open the script file
   - Connect to your database
   - Execute the script

3. If you want to keep existing data, comment out the DELETE statements at the beginning of the script.

## Notes

- The script is designed to work with the database schema defined in the application.
- All passwords are stored in plain text for simplicity. In a production environment, you should use password hashing.
- You can modify the user details, equipment, and other data to suit your specific needs.
